## Texture Packer

Built for use with LibGDX.

### Format

In a configuration file (`/in/info.txt` by default), have a bunch of sprites with the format `name_WxH.png`, where `W` and `H` represent the number of sprites that fit in the image across its width and height, respectively. For example, `apple_3x5.png` mean a sprite named `apple` that has `5` rows and `3` columns.
